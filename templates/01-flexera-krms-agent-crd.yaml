                              by the pod will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using
                              an unrelated volume by mistake. Starting the pod is
                              then blocked until the unrelated PVC is removed. If
                              such a pre-created PVC is meant to be used by the pod,
                              the PVC has to updated with an owner reference to the
                              pod once the pod exists. Normally this should not be
                              necessary, but it may be useful when manually reconstructing

                                      There are two important differences between
                                      DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource
                                      only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef   allows
                                      any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                      objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                      values (dropping them), DataSourceRef   preserves
                                      all values, and generates an error if a disallowed
                                      value is   specified. (Beta) Using this field
                                      requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate
                                      to be enabled.'

                                      There are two important differences between
                                      DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource
                                      only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef   allows
                                      any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                      objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                      values (dropping them), DataSourceRef   preserves
                                      all values, and generates an error if a disallowed
                                      value is   specified. (Beta) Using this field
                                      requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate

                                      There are two important differences between
                                      DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource
                                      only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef   allows
                                      any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                      objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                      values (dropping them), DataSourceRef   preserves
                                      all values, and generates an error if a disallowed
                                      value is   specified. (Beta) Using this field
                                      requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate
                                      to be enabled.'

                                      There are two important differences between
                                      DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource
                                      only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef   allows
                                      any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                      objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                      values (dropping them), DataSourceRef   preserves
                                      all values, and generates an error if a disallowed
                                      value is   specified. (Beta) Using this field
                                      requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate
                                      to be enabled.'
